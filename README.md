 We set out to create a game that would be simple at it’s heart,  but humorous enough entertain a wide audience. The idea to build off of the classic “naked at school nightmare” fit that criteria in our eyes as we believe it to be relatable to most everyone.
 The game is available for both Mac and PC users and can be installed from the Installations folder.
 For more information about the process behind designing the game, visit any of our documents such as the Project Plan and Concept of Operations for more user friendly information, or the Software Requirements and Software Architecture for anyone interested in development.
